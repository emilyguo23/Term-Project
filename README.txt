Project Name: Sandbox Map Creator

Sandbox Map Creator allows the user to customize their own 3D map by adjusting the elevation of a wireframe grid and assigning colors to specific altitudes. The user can then save their elevation map in a .txt file that can be re-uploaded in the main screen to allow the user to continue editing that specific map.

How To Run: 
The files 'modeFunctions.py', 'terrainMode.py', 'colorMode.py', 'interface.py', 'splash_screen.png', and 'color_reference.png' should be in the same directory in order to run Sandbox. To launch the app, run the file 'modeFunctions.py'. Any elevations that the user saves will be saved to the directory in which they have the above files, but the user does not need to begin with any initial .txt files.

Libraries Needed:
Sandbox requires the libraries numpy, scipy.spatial, random, math, copy, and string. 

Shortcut commands:
Sandbox does not have any shortcut commands; buttons at bottom left and bottom right of screen are used to navigate.
